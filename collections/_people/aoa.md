I am a PhD Student in the Genome Sciences program at the University of Washington.
My interests lie in using viral genomes and host characteristics to better undwerstand how host traits, like immune history and group membership, influence epidemic transmission dynamics.
My previous work has focused on using phylogenies to understand feeding ecology and reproductive ecology across the evolution of bony fishes (i.e., not sharks/skates/rays).

Outisde of lab, I enjoy making music and going to shows.
