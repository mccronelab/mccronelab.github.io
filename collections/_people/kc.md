Post-Doctoral Research Fellow.

I'm currently working on vector representations and machine learning for phylogenetic trees, aiming to speed up tree inference for large (probably viral) data sets.
In the past I've worked on machine learning models for complex trait prediction, as well as high-performance regression models with interactions.
More generally, I'm interested in solving computationally difficult problems in biology.

Since moving to Seattle I've developed a serious rowing addiction.
