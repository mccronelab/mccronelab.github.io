I am an Assistant Professor at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center. 
My primary appointment is in the BBE program within the Vaccines and Infectious Diseases Division. 
I  enjoy trying to wrap my head around new ideas, and  viral phylodynamics provides endless fodder to grapple with. 
In the lab we develop and apply new methods to understand how viruses evolve and spread in populations.  

Outside of the lab, I enjoying playing sports (running, baseball, hockey etc.), and perpetually wish I knew more about music. 
I play the trumpet, and at one point was not terrible.
<!-- Most of my leisure time is now consumed sharing these interests with my kids.  -->
