I am a Bioinformatic Analyst II at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, under the BBE program in the Vaccines and Infectious Diseases Division. 
I love applying computational techniques to novel biological questions, particularly in the realm of viral genome analysis. I earned a Master's in Cellular, Microbial, and Molecular Biology and a Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of Montana and aspire to falling into the space between CS and Microbiology. I recently joined the McCrone lab (April 2024), and look forward to plumbing the depths of viral evolution through phylodynamics.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, bird watching, playing games with friends, and cooking.
